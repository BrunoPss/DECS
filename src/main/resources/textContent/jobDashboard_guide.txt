This is the main view of the web application, where the primary functionalities of the
system are located.

The upper panel displays a table of all available problems, offering basic information
about each problem and the option to edit its parameter files.

To execute a problem, it must first be selected from this list.

A job progress bar provides a visual representation of the current status and completion
percentage of the ongoing job. This value is calculated by comparing the current generation
of the evolution process with the respective stopping condition. Since it is impossible to
precisely estimate in which generation a solution will be found, predicting when a job will
terminate is not feasible, as a job concludes only when a solution is identified.
This means that the progress bar does not need to reach 100% completion for a solution to be found.

The bottom panel displays job-specific components, such as a job activity list, where running
and finished jobs are listed, distinguished by their status value, and their respective solutions
can be accessed.

On the right side, the currently executing job real-time metrics are displayed and updated for
each generation, as the start/stop control buttons.
