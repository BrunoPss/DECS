The process of creating a problem from scratch, including all the parameter files for
the evolutionary configuration of ECJ can be complicated and time-consuming,
especially for users unfamiliar with the framework.

Addressing this issue, DECS provides a basic problem builder that maps the possible
parameters into user-friendly components with data validation rules, eliminating possible errors.

Since ECJ was originally conceived to be expandable, based on the supported features and algorithms,
this creates a higher level of complexity in the parameter configuration, which
gets close to a programming language. Creating a simple user interface that supports
all the parameters and their combinational behaviors poses a huge challenge, which can
be compared to the creation of a block-based user interface for a small programming
language.

One way to simplify this problem is to allow the creation of new problems
based on existing ones with the possibility of tweaking the most relevant parameters,
with a special focus on the distribution configuration. The following image shows the
Koza tab of the problem editor.

Each tab represents a group of parameters that a pre-built problem supports.

Since the Island Model can be difficult to configure textually through property/value attributes,
due to the complex migration customization possibilities, there is a special tab
for this distribution technique, illustrated in the following image.

The core components of this model are the islands, so a list is provided where these
are displayed. Further individual island customization can be made in the Island Editor,
where it is possible to define the respective migration configurations.
