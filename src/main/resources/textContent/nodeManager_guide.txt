The Node Manager is a view that provides information about the connected
processing nodes.

Each node can be further analyzed, retrieving real-time information
about the hardware and characteristics of the machine in which it is being executed.

This information is often relevant when performing experiments with a specfic
cluster, where the hardware and software specifications of the processing nodes should
be collected and included in the results.
